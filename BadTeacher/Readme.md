# Bad Teaching Unlearning on CIFAR-Super20

This repository contains my implementation of the **"Can Bad Teaching Induce Forgetting? Unlearning in Deep Networks using an Incompetent Teacher"** paper (AAAI 2023) applied on the **CIFAR-Super20 dataset**.

The work introduces a novel machine unlearning framework where an *incompetent teacher* model guides a student to forget specific data while retaining knowledge from a *competent teacher*. This implementation focuses on evaluating the impact of bad teaching on **retain and forget accuracy**.
