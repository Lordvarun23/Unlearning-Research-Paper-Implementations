# Unlearning-Research-Paper-Implementations
A collection of reproducible implementations of state-of-the-art research papers in **machine unlearning**. This repository provides clean, modular, and well-documented codebases for various unlearning algorithms, enabling benchmarking, experimentation, and further research in privacy-preserving AI.

## Overview

Machine unlearning is an emerging area focused on enabling models to selectively forget specific data points without the need for full retraining. This capability is increasingly important for complying with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, and for improving data lifecycle management in AI systems.

This repository currently includes an implementation of the **Bad Teaching** unlearning method applied on the **CIFAR-Super20** dataset. The method leverages an *incompetent teacher* to induce forgetting in a student model while preserving knowledge from a competent teacher.

### Planned Additions

- Amnesiac Unlearning  
- UNSIR  
- SSD  
- Other recent and impactful unlearning algorithms
